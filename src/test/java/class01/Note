*****My Note  *******
we test software in 2 ways:

1:manual testing -
ex: facebook; you test , am i able to login when i enter user name and password on facebook. manual testing it create
 problem because  it takes time to test every single product , it takes time .
2: automation
What tools we use to automate a website?
 selenium.
 What is selenium:
 is a tool that help us to automate webApplication


 HTML: it is a coding language tool ,

 <button>     button  is a tag it is between <>
 <image>    image a tag
  when there is iamge.

 < html>        < open of tag
 <head>                                         child
 <body>
 </html>         </ >close of tag

 1:    every open htlm should have a closing tag. ex :    <html>    open
                                                      </html>   close



  <h2  title ="Im a header">    the tile  /h2>        =>h2 is tag  , title is attribute  , value of attribute is header
  <image  style = "width 123"
    - imag is tag, style is attribute , width is value of attribute
   2:    attribute make changes to the image and information

   3:    text- it is between open and close of a tag . ex:
    <h2>   image as a link  </h2>         image as a link=> text


 ex:    <button  style ="40px"> hello< /button>
    <button is tag
    style is attribute that has value 40px
    hello is text , cuz it is between open tag and close tag


   ex:  facebook login user name , pass, login
   <html>
   <input>       =>username
   <input>      => username
   <button>  login  </button>           => login
   </html>


    anything you see on website is webElement.
locator are used to located the webElement and interact with them .
8 locator :
name,
id
class
linktext
partialLinktext
tagname,
xpath
css

******************
Instructor Note

get() vs navigate()
-- navigate can move back, forward and refresh
-- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application


    What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

    HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

    What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

    Locator
    is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
    is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

    8 Locators:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Tagname
    - xpath
    - linktext
    - partialLinkText
    - CSS Selector
    - ClassName


    Why do we need many locators?
    -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
    -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements



    <button>click me</button>
    a text is always located betweeen >< of the tag (i.e opening and closing of the tag
    the above tag has text

    <a href="g"></a>
    the above tag has no text
